        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This privacy policy explains how GoQrcode (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects the data of users (“you” or “your”) of our mobile application, available on the App Store. We are committed to ensuring your privacy is protected.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            GoQrcode does not collect any personal data from users. The app only allows users to create, store, and share QR codes locally on their devices. No information is transmitted to external servers or third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Any QR codes created by the app are stored locally on your device. The app does not store, track, or transmit any data to external servers. You have full control over the QR codes and can share them via other apps or delete them as you wish.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or rent any data from users to third parties. The app only allows sharing of QR codes at the user's discretion, and no data is transmitted to external parties unless you choose to share it yourself.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take the security of your data seriously. Since no personal information is stored or transmitted, there is no sensitive data at risk. However, we recommend that you keep your device secure with appropriate security measures such as a passcode or biometric authentication.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy on this page with an updated revision date. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.
        </p>
